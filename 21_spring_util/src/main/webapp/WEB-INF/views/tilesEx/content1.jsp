	<h2>Believer - Imagine Dragon</h2>
	<p>First things first
	I'm a say all the words
	inside my head
	I'm fired up
	and tired of the way
	that things have been oh ooh
	The way that things
	have been oh ooh
	Second thing second
	Don't you tell me
	what you think that I could be
	I'm the one at the sail
	I'm the master of my sea oh ooh
	The master of my sea oh ooh
	I was broken from a young age
	Taking my sulking to the masses
	Writing my poems for the few
	That look at me took to me
	shook to me feeling me
	Singing from heartache
	from the pain </p>
