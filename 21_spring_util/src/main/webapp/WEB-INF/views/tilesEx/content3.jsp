	<h2>I'm so tired - Lauv</h2>
	<p>I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
	Tired of love songs, tired of love
	Just wanna go home, wanna go home
	Wanna go home, woah
	So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
	Tired of love songs, tired of love
	Just wanna go home, wanna go home
	Wanna go home, woah
	Party, trying my best to meet somebody
	But everybody around me is falling in love to our song
	I, I, oh I, I, yeah
	Hate it, taking a shot 'cause I can't take it
	But I don't think that they make anything that strong, so I hold on
	I, I, oh I, I, yeah
	I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
	Tired of love songs, tired of love
	Just wanna go home, wanna go home </p>
