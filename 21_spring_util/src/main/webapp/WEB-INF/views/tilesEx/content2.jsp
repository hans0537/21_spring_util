	<h2>Dance Monkey - Tones and I</h2>
	<p>They say, "Oh my god",
	I see the way you shine
	Take your hand, my dear,
	and place them both in mine
	You know you stopped me
	dead when I was passing by
	And now I beg to see you
	dance just one more time
	Ooh, I see you, see you,
	see you every time
	And I, I, I, I like your style
	You, you make me, make me,
	make me wanna cry
	And now I beg to see you
	dance just one more time</p>
